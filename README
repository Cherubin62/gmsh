This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator, primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities.

To install Gmsh, type

./configure
make
make install

This requires the GSL (http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/) and FLTK 1.1.x
(http://www.fltk.org), configured with OpenGL support, to be installed
on your system. If not in default locations, you can either use the
--with-fltk-prefix and --with-gsl-prefix configure options, or you can
set the environment variables FLTK_DIR and GSL_DIR.

To install a non-graphical version of Gmsh (that does not require
FLTK nor OpenGL), type

./configure --disable-gui
make
make install
