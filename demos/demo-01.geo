/* README: You can merge files with File->Merge. This is most useful
   for post-processing purposes. Try for example to merge view1.pos
   together with this file.  Post-processing options are available by
   right-clicking on the view button. You can also directly launch
   Gmsh with several files as arguments on the command line. The first
   will be 'opened', the others will be 'merged'. 

   For example, try 'gmsh ex01.geo view01.pos view02.pos'. Two view
   buttons will appear in the post-processing menu, respectively
   labeled "a scalar map" and "a vector map". A left mouse click will
   toggle the visibility of the particular view. A right mouse click
   will give you access to the view's options:

   - Reload: reload the file from which the view was loaded
   - Remove: removes the view
   - Duplicate: makes a copy of the view (without duplicating the data)
   - Lighting: activates/deactivates lighting for the view
   - Scale: gives access to the scale menu (range definition, iso-value
     choice, ...)
   - Color: defines the colormap for the view
   - Offset: permits to move the view around, and to make elevation 
     maps
   - Vector display: change vector attributes
   - Time step: select the displayed time step
   - Export as background mesh: exports the map, considered as an
     error map, as a background mesh, i.e. as a characteristic length map
   - Apply as current bg mesh: applies the view as the current background 
     mesh.  

   If you want modifications made to one view to affect also all 
   other views, select the appropriate option in Options->Post-Processing
