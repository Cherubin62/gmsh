h = 0.1 ;

Extrude Surface { 6, {0,0,h} };

// and specify a different characteristic length to some of the
// automatically created nodes

Characteristic Length{5,14} = lc * 5 ;

// And define a volume

/* README: In the same way one defines line loops to build surfaces,
   one must define surface loops to build volumes. The following
   volume is very simple, without holes (only one surface loop in the
   volume) */
